# CVE-2019-11561

[Suggested description]

    The Chuango 433 MHz burglar-alarm product line is vulnerable to a
    Denial of Service attack. When the condition is triggered, the OV2
    base station is unable to process sensor states and effectively
    prevents the alarm from setting off,
    as demonstrated by Chuango branded products, and non-Chuango branded products such as the Eminent 
    EM8617 OV2 Wifi Alarm System.
